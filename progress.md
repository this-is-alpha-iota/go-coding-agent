### Brave Search 429s on concurrent requests (2025-07-17)

**Problem:** When multiple `web_search` tool calls fire in the same turn (parallel
execution), all requests hit the Brave API simultaneously. Brave's free tier
rate-limits to ~1 query/second, so only the first request succeeds and the rest
get 429'd.

The original 429 error message was also misleading — it claimed "You've reached
your monthly search limit (2000 free searches)" regardless of whether the 429 was
from per-second throttling or actual quota exhaustion. (The free tier is actually
~1,000 searches/month via $5 of credits, not 2,000.)

**Fix (`agent/tools/web_search.go`):**
- Added retry loop with exponential backoff (up to 3 retries: 1s, 2s, 4s) on 429
  responses. This handles the common concurrent-search case transparently.
- Updated the 429 error message (when retries are exhausted) to accurately
  distinguish per-second rate limiting from monthly quota issues, and points to the
  Brave dashboard for usage checking.
- Worst-case adds ~7s latency per search if all retries fire, but in practice most
  concurrent searches succeed on the first 1s retry.

**Root cause analysis:** The issue was diagnosed by observing that 1 of 4
simultaneous searches succeeded while 3 failed, and subsequent individual searches
worked fine — ruling out monthly quota exhaustion.
